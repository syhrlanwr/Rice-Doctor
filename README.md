## Backgrounder:

Being the staple food in the majority of Southeast Asia, it is very crucial to understand the health of paddy and rice before being consumed by the majority. Surely, the quality of the rice will always be controlled by the related institution. However, there are many factors contributing to the quality change in the rice after being controlled by the institutions. To ensure the high quality of the staple food, we came up with the solution to make an app that will help people double check the rice quality based on the rice they have at home.


1.  Machine Learning: collecting data through Kaggle datasets, building and training models using TensorFlow
    
2.  Mobile Development: Implementing MQTT mechanism of communication in the backend and mobile apps. Also creating a simple dashboard for monitoring the services availability, logging, and housekeeping purposes.
    
3.  Cloud Computing: creating API for authentication and authorization along with the API testing, and have successfully deployed the API to GCP.

## Disclaimer
Due to the inactivity of our MD member, we have been doing our best to develop the application using Flutter instead of the native language.
